# Eigenlearning

This repo contains code for replicating the experiments of the paper [A Theory of the Inductive Bias and Generalization of Kernel Regression and Wide Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03922). The ```.py``` files provide a general codebase for generating synthetic datasets, loading image datasets, and testing the performance of kernel regression and finite nets learning functions on these domains. The ```.ipynb``` files in the ```experiments``` directory run selected experiments and generating the associated figures.

As of Spring 2022, this repo is under active development. If you discover any bugs or want to request any changes, let us know!
